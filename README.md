I worked on a Forest Cover Type Classification project using Python and machine learning. Using the UCI Covertype dataset, I predicted forest cover types based on 
cartographic and environmental features. I cleaned and prepared the data, including handling categorical variables, before training and testing multi-class classification models. 
I visualized the results with a confusion matrix and analyzed feature importance. I also compared different tree-based models, such as Random Forest and XGBoost, and improved performance 
through hyperparameter tuning.The tools I used were Pandas, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost.
